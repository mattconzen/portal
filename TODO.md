We challenge you to continue learning and exploring more of Elixir by taking your portal application to the next level:

	* Add a Portal.push_left/1 function that transfers the data in the other direction. How can you avoid the code duplication existing between the push_left/1 and push_right/1 functions?

	* Learn more about ExUnit, Elixir's testing framework, and write tests for the functionality we have built so far. Remember we already have a default structure laid out in the test directory.

	* Generate HTML documentation for your project with ExDoc.

	* Push your project to an external source, like Github, and publish a package using the Hex package manager.
